<div>This app creates a realized version of a .psd file for a front-end task. In the task, there were two pages specified. However, because the only real difference between them was the middle section, the app generates them both as a single web app. Furthermore, pressing the buttons in header and footer sections scrolls the app to the respective section.</div>

<div>Before running this app, make sure the most recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed.</div>

## Quick start

```sh
cd weather-app/

npm install react react-dom
npm install react-scripts
npm start
```

<div>Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.</div>
